									<h1>Text Classification using Deep Learning</h1>
									<p>This study explores how Transfer Learning can be employed for classification tasks in NLP to train state-of-the-art pretrained models such as BERT and ULMFiT and how well they stack up against the traditional deep learning models</p>

								<p>Text Classification is a classical problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where certain sentences, paragraphs or documents need to be assigned to one or 
									more predefined categories. Deep learning models based on recurrent structures have been able to surpass issues faced by conventional machine learning models 
									and achieve satisfactory results in classifying text data by utilizing semantic information. While Deep Learning (DL) models have achieved state-of-the-art on 
									many NLP tasks, these models are trained from scratch, requiring large datasets, and days to converge. These major drawbacks of DL models have been addressed through 
									Inductive Transfer learning. Transfer Learning (TL) has thus changed the face of DL in NLP in the recent years by allowing us to take pretrained state of the art 
									models and fine tuning them to suit the task at hand , thus obviating the need for training language models from scratch. This study, apart from exploring some DL 
									models, would be focusing on two of the most popular TL models namely, Universal Language Model Fine Tuning (ULMFiT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
									Transformers (BERT) that employ transfer learning to classify news articles into predefined categories.</p>
